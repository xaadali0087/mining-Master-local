Mining Masters is an NFT-powered, play-to-earn resource management mining game where players can stake Mining NFTs, embark on mining expeditions, and optimize their operations to maximize profits. The game combines strategic gameplay, time-based mechanics, and RNG (Random Number Generation) elements to create a dynamic and rewarding experience.

## Overview

- Free meals have low chances of success, while Gem-based meals increase the chances of a successful gem haul but come at a cost.
